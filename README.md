# Bama Car Data Analysis: Web Scraping, Anomaly Detection, Recommendation & Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project combines web scraping, machine learning, and data analysis techniques to extract valuable insights from Bama, a popular Iranian online car marketplace.  It encompasses data acquisition, cleaning, anomaly detection, personalized car recommendations, and sentiment analysis of user reviews. This comprehensive approach demonstrates my ability to build an end-to-end data science solution, from data gathering to actionable insights.

## Key Features

*   **Web Scraping:**  Employs Scrapy to efficiently extract car details (price, model, year, mileage, etc.) from Bama's website. Robust error handling and data cleaning techniques ensure high-quality data.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Implements anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to identify unusual car listings, potentially uncovering fraudulent or exceptional deals. This showcases my ability to identify outliers and handle data irregularities.
*   **Recommendation System:** Develops a personalized car recommendation system using techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering. This system suggests relevant cars to users based on their preferences and past behavior, demonstrating my understanding of machine learning for personalization.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Performs sentiment analysis on user reviews and comments related to car listings.  This provides insights into customer opinions and overall satisfaction with different car models, highlighting my NLP skills and ability to extract subjective information.
*   **Machine Learning Pipeline:**  The project showcases a complete machine learning pipeline, from data collection and preprocessing to model building, evaluation, and deployment (conceptually).
*   **Data Visualization:** Uses libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations of the data, anomaly detection results, recommendation system performance, and sentiment analysis trends.

## Technologies Used

*   **Scrapy:**  For web scraping and data extraction.
*   **Python:**  The primary programming language for data manipulation, model building, and analysis.
*   **Pandas:**  For data manipulation and cleaning.
*   **NumPy:**  For numerical computations.
*   **Scikit-learn:** For implementing machine learning models (anomaly detection, recommendation, sentiment analysis).
*   **NLTK/SpaCy:** For natural language processing tasks (sentiment analysis).
*   **Matplotlib/Seaborn:**  For data visualization.
*   **[Optional:  Specify any cloud platforms or deployment tools used, e.g., Docker, AWS, Heroku]**

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/iamdanial79/bama_scrapy_ML.git
    cd bama_scrapy_ML
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **[Provide specific instructions for running the scraper, anomaly detection, recommendation, and sentiment analysis components.  Include example commands.]**  For example:

    *   **To run the scraper:**  `cd scrapy_project; scrapy crawl bama_spider`
    *   **To run the anomaly detection:** `python anomaly_detection/main.py`

## Example Usage

[Provide clear examples of how to use the different components of your project.  This could include code snippets or descriptions of how to interact with the system.]

*   **Example 1:  Finding anomalous car listings:** "Run the `anomaly_detection/main.py` script.  The output will be a list of car listing IDs identified as anomalies, along with their features."
*   **Example 2:  Getting car recommendations:**  "Use the `recommendation/api.py` to send a request with user preferences. The API will return a list of recommended car listings."
*   **Example 3:  Analyzing sentiment:** "Run the `sentiment_analysis/analyze.py` script, providing a text review as input.  The script will output the sentiment score (positive, negative, or neutral)."

## Potential Enhancements

*   **Real-time Data Scraping:** Implement a scheduled scraping process to keep the data up-to-date.
*   **Advanced Recommendation Algorithms:** Explore more sophisticated recommendation techniques, such as deep learning-based models.
*   **Improved Sentiment Analysis:**  Fine-tune the sentiment analysis model using a larger and more relevant dataset.
*   **Deployment:** Deploy the recommendation system and sentiment analysis components as a web service.
*   **User Interface:** Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.
